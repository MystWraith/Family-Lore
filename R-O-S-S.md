From Megan and Karin's marching band show called "The joy of painting." Obviously, it was in reference to Bob Ross and was centered around painting. At the end of the show, the band lays down spelling "ROSS." On one of the judges tapes, the judge says "R-O-S-S. I don't know, but it must mean something to the band."
