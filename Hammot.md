A quote from the comedian Nate Bargatze. He was going to buy a hammock and approached a (presumed) worker. When he asked about hammocks, the person responded with "What's a hammock?"
Nate was so taken aback that he doubted himself,  "I must be saying this wrong, because I know you know what this is. It is hammot? With a T?"
The guy responds "We're fresh out of hammots. It's hammot season."
So Nate leaves, and googles where to buy a hammot, and gets "where to buy a ***hammock***."
