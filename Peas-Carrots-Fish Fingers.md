This is from an online game from a series called Charlie and Lola. In that game, you must convince Lola that peas, carrots, and fish fingers are fun to eat.

We commonly say "I don't eat **p**eas, or **c**arrots, or **f**ish **f**ingers!" (additional emphasis usually placed on the leading consonantsâ€”bolded here.)
