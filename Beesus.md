This is a strange one. There was a Bee Movie game for the Wii. [Megan Nelson](Megan%20Nelson) would drive around in the game and say "would you like to talk about our lord and savior Beesus Christ?" This is in parody of Missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

This was suggested as an addition by [Grace Nelson](Grace%20Nelson). It seems to have stuck with her.

The interesting thing is that "Beesus" isn't even what the bee-equivalent to Jesus is in the Bee Movie. It's actually "Bejesus."
