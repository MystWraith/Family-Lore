Karin, Tim, and Megan had come over for dinner. We were eating out and Jeremy was paying. Some peanut butter and rice treats were left on the counter from a pervious day. Karin picked one up.

Jeremy said "You won't get dinner if you eat that."

Karin responded, saying "I'm 24, I can eat it if I want."

"Let me rephrase," Jeremy smiled. "I won't pay for your dinner if you eat that."

Karin shrugged. "I'm only 24!" she said.
