My full name is Jeffrey Phillip Nelson. I am named after my two grandfathers. My first name is by paternal-grandfather's first name. My middle name is my maternal-grandfather's middle name, which is the name he goes by.

I am autistic, properly diagnosed with ASD1. I'm generally considered very intelligent and am math oriented, which disproportionately represents a majority of the "genius" label. I'm tech oriented and am a programmer. I am/will go to the University of Arizona and plan to major in software engineering.

When I was growing up, I had issues with communicating and emotions. I still do to some extent, but I have improved greatly.
