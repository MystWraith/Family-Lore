"In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol [![Logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Prince_logo.svg/20px-Prince_logo.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prince_logo.svg "The unpronounceable symbol (later dubbed \"Love Symbol #2\")") (known to fans as the "**Love Symbol**") and was often referred to as **The Artist Formerly Known as Prince** (or **TAFKAP**)" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician))

This phrase "The Artist Formerly Known as" has made it into the Nelson Lore because [JP Nelson](JP%20Nelson.md)'s best friend Ben/June Petrie changed the name they went by. So, often when talking about them in the past tense, it becomes "The Person Formerly Known as Ben."

This change is often approached with tenderness and more than a little confusion. Ben/June is someone who is greatly cared about and, while their state of being might be confusing, they are loved.
