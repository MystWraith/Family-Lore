This is a commonly exaggerated true story.

When Jeremy was younger, he was on the house boat with his family. When pulling up to the dock, Jeremy was assigned to tie the boat to the bollard. There was still a ways to the dock, and Jeffrey Nelson, Jeremy's father, told him to "Jump for the dock!"

The distance to the dock and length of the rope are uncertain. Those are the details that are commonly exaggerated.
