While and Tim/Jeremy's birthday dinner (7/24/2025) at P.F. Chang's, Karin ordered a pomegranate lemonade. She enjoyed it.
When Amanda asked to try some, Karin said "I'm not crazy about it," referring to sharing drinks and therefore germs. However, everyone at the table other than JP and Karin thought that it meant that she wasn't crazy about the pomegranate lemonade.
