This is a satirical movie parodying Star Trek.

The first one is "Let's go before one of them kills Guy!"

The second one is from the deleted scenes where guy tries to shoot the villain and the gun jams.
"I knew that was going to happen."
Soon after he gets thrown by said villain
"Help me." With a rather amusing voice crack.
