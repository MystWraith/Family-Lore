Quest was a series that the Nelson kids made with the Petrie's kids. Primarily recorded on the [Flip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Video) and edited in iMovie. Two movies and one trailer was made.

One quote has remained from Quest in the Nelson lore:
"I've been here for like an hour." From the character played by young Ben/June.
