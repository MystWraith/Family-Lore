This is a collection of quotes, all of which originated from a YouTube series known as Kid History. The premise is that some siblings told stories from when they were younger to their little kids. Then they asked for their kids to retell the story. Finally, they acted out and recorded the retellings with their children's voices dubbed over their own.

These quotes include:
* Why's it green/gross? (AAAAA)
* I'm Jake and I'm poking the snake!
* Facial discracial
* My bof favaei. (I like red grapes, and purple grapes, and...)
* Do it Bandy!
* Mike! (I'm gonna kick you in the head)
* I'm in a lot of twouble
* Ninja Vanish!
* SH! SH! SH!
* Oceanology! FACT!
* Don't hit me in the face with a bike! (I don't even have a bike. It's right there!)
* I can't bite it. I mean, I can kinda bite it.
