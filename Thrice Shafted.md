From the fifth episode of season 1, "Big Day."

According to the usual plan,Â everyone will get a bonus of $400, except for one person who will get the "Big Bonus" of $3000, and one person who will get a $0 bonus, or "The Shaft."

A character named Matthew has received "The Shaft" three years in a row. He states that he has been "Thrice Shafted."

This is primarily quoted by Jeffrey Duane Nelson, [Jeremy Nelson](Jeremy%20Nelson.md)'s father.
