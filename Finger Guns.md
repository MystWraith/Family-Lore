While playing a game whose euphemized name is Poop/Crap on your neighbor, someone played three 6's. Someone said "666," in reference to the "Devil's Number." After a pause, Ben/June did finger guns. Now it gets repeated by [JP Nelson](JP%20Nelson.md), [Grace Nelson](Grace%20Nelson), and [Megan Nelson](Megan%20Nelson) in several situations when 666 is seen.
