While on a band trip to France, the band was on the bus and saw someone with a baguette in the passenger seat of their car (I believe it was wearing a seatbelt). So they said "That's not a baguette, that's a child!"

Karin and Megan quoted it and explained when they returned home, and now it's part of the Nelson Lore.
