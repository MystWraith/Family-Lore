Based on the real philosophy of [Cosmic Ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ordering), "space star ordering" is a parody from the episode "Something Happened" (Season 4, Episode 3) from the [IT Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd).

This is included in the Lore Book because of Amanda's former step-brother-in-law, Troy. He participates in a pyramid scheme that shares similar themes and ideas as space star ordering.

Some scenes are referenced nearly verbatim. These include:
* Buying a helicopter
* Drawing a tattoo of a helicopter
* Getting a robot arm after the tattoo gets infected.
